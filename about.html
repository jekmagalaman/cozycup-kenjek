            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                 The idea behind CozyCup Café was to establish a 
                 space where coffee enthusiasts could come together
                  and enjoy excellent brews in an inviting environment.
                   Established in 2020, our mission is to deliver amazing customer
                    service and serve premium coffee from environmentally friendly farms.
                     Everything we do is motivated by our appreciation of coffee.
